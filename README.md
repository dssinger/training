This program reformats the information on the Toastmasters' District Central Club Officer Training page into something
more easily shared and looked at.

There are three output files:

training.html
training.xlsx
lucky7.html  (clubs having all 7 officers trained)

Saving the information from the Toastmasters web page can be tricky, since it's in an iframe on the District Central page.
